# Angular assignment - Attribute management

## Assignment - 1

### Task 1 - Create a new angular application

- Project initialization

- Why does Angular offer both approaches?      
Angular offers both approaches because the ngModule approach has been present since a very long time and a lot of enterprise applications and packages are written in ngModule, whereas the standalone approach has been the default since Angular 17 making it backward compatible and easier to learn and use Angular.

- In what kind of project would you pick standalone over NgModule?      
Standalone has been the default approach that Angular has opted since Angular 17 because it reduces a lot of boilerplate code and makes development easier and faster as compared to NgModules. I would prefer standalone over NgModules in almost every situation where we don't have to explicity use the rigid, heavy modular approach provided by the NgModules.

### Task 2 - Create TypeScript interfaces

### Task 3 - Create Attribute Service

- Create AttributeService
![Create AttributeService](screenshots/Create%20AttribueService.png)

- In-memory array of at least 8 diverse Attribute records

- What would change if you provided this service at component level? When would you choose that?             
If this service was provided at a component level, then we would have to describe the in memory attribute array and all the related methods to the attribute array in each and every component where it is used, whereas with the service AttributeService we have a global store through which all the components can share the data instead of repeating the same code at multiple places. I would choose the component level definition of the array and methods where only that specific component uses the data and methods of the service.

### Task 4 - Create AttributeListComponent

- Create AttributeListComponent

- Attribute list

### Task 5 - Create AttributeCardComponent 

- Create AttributeCardComponent 
![Create AttributeCardComponent](screenshots/Create%20AttributeCard%20Component.png)

- Attribute card view

- Attribute table view

### Task 6 - Implement ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy in AttributeCardComponent

- Console.log() after switching to card layout

- Console.log() after switching back to table layout          
![Console.log() after switching back to table layout](screenshots/Hooks%20sequence%20after%20the%20table%20toggle.png)

- In what order do hooks fire when the list loads?         
No hooks fire when the list loads since the table layout is the default layout in the attribute-list component.

- What fires when you switch between table/card view?              
When the toggle is switched from the table view to the card view, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit hooks are fired for each card with its id since the attribute-card component inherits the attributes as @Input from its parent attribute-list component and initializes the card view or layout.           
Whereas when the toggle is switched from the card view to the table view, the card layout no longer exists in the view, therefore the ngOnDestroy hook is fired for each attribute with its id.

- What fires when you remove an attribute? What real-world cleanup would you do in ngOnDestroy?           
When an attribute is removed from the list and its corresponding AttributeCard component is removed from the view, Angular calls ngOnDestroy() for that card instance. The console log displays the ID of the attribute associated with the destroyed component.         
Real world leanup that I would perform in ngOnDestroy hook is to clear up any tasks such as setTimeout and setInterval and clear up any resource which isn't needed any longer to avoid memory leak issues.

### Task 7 - Custom attribute directive appActiveStatus

### Task 8 - Create a custom pipe RelativeTimePipe

### Task 9 - Add a search box

- Add a search box        
![Add a search box](screenshots/Search%20box.png)

- Why use a structural directive instead of a pipe?         
A structural directive controls whether an element exists in the DOM.
Here, it creates the row/card when the attribute matches the search
term and removes it when it doesn't.

A pipe would be more appropriate when the goal is to transform an
array into a filtered array for display.

### Task 10 - Create AddAttributeComponent
